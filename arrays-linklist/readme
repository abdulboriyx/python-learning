Linked lists are generally better for insertion and removal of elements (especially when done at the beginning or in the middle) because they don't require shifting elements in memory. For lists (arrays), shifting can lead to O(n) time complexity, while linked lists can perform these operations in O(1) time (if you already have a reference to the node).
