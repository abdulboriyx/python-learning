__new__ is a special method in Python used to control the creation of new instances. It is primarily used in the Singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance of a class is created and used throughout the program. By overriding __new__, you can control whether a new instance is created or an existing one is returned.


car-comp.py - using __getitem__() dunder, I created class called CarComp to compare user car's speed & horsepower.
