# python-learning

I have started learning Python through Harvard's CS50P course. Here, I record my Python learning journey. 

November 6th(2024) - I completed the first lecture of CS50P, covering functions and variables. 

I have learnt: 

      - Variables 
      
      - Functions and how to create custom functions

      - Return values & side effects
