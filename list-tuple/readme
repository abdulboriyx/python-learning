List - contains any type of data and elements inside list can be changed or reassigned; [] are used for list

Tuple - contains any type of data, however elements inside tuple can't be changed or reassigned; () are used for tuple

Set - unordered data type, they can't be accessed with indexing like list or tuple; elements can be removed or added; no duplication

Dictionary - key-value pair data type; keys are unique and immutable while values can be repeated and changeable; compared to list, dict is faster

JSON - language independent, lightweight datainterchanging format; is used to send data between computers;

json.dumps gives back string to use in python code; json.dump is used to write into json file itself;

Hashable - are objects that have fixed hash value, dict, set and tuple can be example for them. List is unhashable because it is mutable -> meaning the content inside list can be changed, modified and don't need to be unique

Dictionary keys -> must be hashable objects

Duplicated keys are also NOT allowed in Python dict. Instead of adding new key-pair value, you delete the previous one and change it with the new one if you want to add new key-pair value. 

However, there is no restriction for value data types; you can input anything, literally any data type you want; 

Positional argument - takes them in order, and passes it to function. Function takes them in their specific order, and uses it them in specific order. 

Keyword argument - passes through parameter name so the order doesn't matter so much. 

Args - takes positional arguments, collects them into tuple, and returns. 

Kwargs - takes kewyword arguments, collects them into dict, and returns dict.
